# Syntax

Elm syntax is very simple, and the official docs offer a wonderful guide to the syntax of Elm. [elm-lang.org/docs/syntax](http://elm-lang.org/docs/syntax).

## Playground

In this section, you will find a module called `Playground.elm`. This module is simply all the Elm syntax examples, but in a form where they actually compile. Please take your time to mess with this file. Break things. Experiment, and get comfortable with Elm's flexible ML/OCaml inspired syntax.

## Inference

Infer the type to practice your reasoning about Elm's syntax. There are some functions of varying difficulty in the `Inference.elm` file. Try to fill out the type annotations for these functions. Answers are in `Complete/Inference.elm`.
